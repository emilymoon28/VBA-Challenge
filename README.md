# Stock Data Analysis via VBA

- Utilizing VBA, I created a macro process to analyze 3 years of stock data. The script loops through each row in each worksheet to summarize the yearly price change and the price change percent for each ticker as well as their total volume.

- Once the summary table is created, the next part is to compare each ticker to find out which one has the greatest price change percent and the greatest volume in the year.
